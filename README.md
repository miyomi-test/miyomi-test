# Miyomi Lab — Testing, Building & Community App Builds

Welcome to Miyomi Lab (miyomi-test). This account is a small community-focused lab where we test, experiment, and build apps from public source code — including community builds and APKs for learning and testing purposes.

## What we do
- Take open-source/course/student/sample code and build runnable artifacts (APKs, test builds, small tooling).
- Run experiments: packaging, automated builds, lightweight CI, and debugging for educational purposes.
- Share notes, build scripts, and instructions so others can reproduce builds locally.
- Help community members get a working build from their public source code when licensing allows.

## How we work
- We prioritize open-source and permissively licensed projects. Before building or sharing artifacts we check repository licenses and respect the original authors’ terms.
- To request a build or help:
  1. Open an issue in the relevant repository with a link to the source and a clear description of what you want built.
  2. Include license info and confirmation you have the right to request distribution of the build.
  3. We’ll reply with what we can do and any limitations or requirements.
- We avoid working with proprietary, paid, or clearly restricted content unless explicit permission is provided by the rights holder.

## Repositories & Artifacts
- This profile hosts small experiments, build scripts, and example workflows. Artifacts (like APKs) may be provided only when permitted by license and contributor consent.
- We document build steps and share CI configs so others can reproduce results without needing pre-built binaries.

## Contributing & Collaborating
- Want to help? Open issues, submit pull requests for build scripts, or share reproducible instructions. Keep contributions focused on reproducibility, license clarity, and safety.
- When submitting source for a community build, include:
  - The repository URL and commit/branch
  - License type (or a statement of permission)
  - Any special build instructions or secrets redaction notes

## Disclaimer
- Builds are experimental and provided "as-is" for testing and educational use. Users are responsible for complying with licenses and laws in their jurisdiction.
- We will not assist with distributing software when it violates copyright, licensing, or terms of service.

## Contact
- GitHub: https://github.com/miyomi-test
- Open an issue in the relevant repo to request builds or collaboration.

Thanks for checking out Miyomi Lab — we’re here to learn, experiment, and help the community reproduce and learn from public source code. If you want this README customized (badges, pinned projects, contact details), tell us what to add and we’ll update it.
